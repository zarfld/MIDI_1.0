# Phase 02: Requirements Analysis & Specification

**Standards**: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (System Requirements), ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017  
**XP Integration**: User Stories, Acceptance Tests, YAGNI Principle

## 🎯 Phase Objectives

1. Transform stakeholder requirements into system requirements
2. Define functional and non-functional requirements
3. Create detailed use cases and user stories
4. Establish requirements traceability
5. Define testable acceptance criteria

## 📋 Requirements Capture Method

### GitHub Issues (Primary and Recommended)

**All requirements MUST be captured as GitHub Issues** using the Functional Requirement (REQ-F) or Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF) templates.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No YAML front matter required - metadata captured via issue fields, labels, and project columns
- ✅ Traceability via `#N` syntax in issue bodies
- ✅ ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 compliance via issue templates
- ✅ Automated validation via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Real-time collaboration and discussion
- ✅ Integration with pull requests and CI/CD
- ✅ Searchable and filterable with labels and milestones

## 📋 ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Compliance

### System Requirements Process Activities

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Decompose stakeholder requirements
   - Identify system boundaries
   - Define interfaces
   - Analyze feasibility
   - Resolve conflicts

2. **System Requirements Specification**
   - Define functional requirements
   - Define non-functional requirements (quality attributes)
   - Specify constraints
   - Define interfaces
   - Create System Requirements Specification (SyRS)

3. **Requirements Validation**
   - Review for completeness
   - Check consistency
   - Verify traceability to stakeholder requirements
   - Validate with stakeholders

## 🎨 XP Practices for This Phase

### User Stories
Transform requirements into user stories:
```markdown
As a [user role]
I want to [action/capability]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]
```

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Only specify requirements for current iteration + 1
- Avoid speculative features
- Keep requirements minimal and focused

### Acceptance Test-Driven Development
- Define acceptance tests BEFORE implementation
- Make acceptance criteria executable
- Customer defines acceptance tests

## 📝 Requirements Documentation Approach

### ⭐ PRIMARY: GitHub Issues (Recommended)

**System requirements should be captured as GitHub Issues** using the Functional Requirement (REQ-F) or Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF) templates.

#### Creating Functional Requirements as GitHub Issues

1. **Navigate to Issues → New Issue**
2. **Select Template**: "Functional Requirement (REQ-F)"
3. **Complete Required Fields**:
   - **Title**: Clear capability statement (e.g., "User can export data to CSV format")
   - **Parent Stakeholder Requirement**: Link to parent StR issue using `#N` syntax
   - **Requirement Description**: What the system shall do (use "shall" for mandatory)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions (Given-When-Then format)
   - **Priority**: Critical (P0) / High (P1) / Medium (P2) / Low (P3)
   - **Integrity Level**: 1 (highest) through 4 (lowest) per IEEE 1012-2016
   - **Dependencies**: Other requirements this depends on
   - **Verification Method**: Inspection / Analysis / Demonstration / Test
   
4. **Apply Labels**:
   - `functional-requirement` (auto-applied by template)
   - `phase-02` (lifecycle phase)
   - `priority-*` and `integrity-*` labels
   
5. **Submit** → GitHub assigns issue number (e.g., #45)

#### Creating Non-Functional Requirements as GitHub Issues

1. **Navigate to Issues → New Issue**
2. **Select Template**: "Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF)"
3. **Complete Required Fields**:
   - **Title**: Quality attribute with metric (e.g., "System response time under 200ms for 95th percentile")
   - **Parent Stakeholder Requirement**: Link to parent StR issue (`#N`)
   - **Quality Attribute Category**: Performance / Security / Usability / Reliability / Maintainability / Portability
   - **Requirement Description**: Specific quality constraint
   - **Measurable Criteria**: Objective metrics and targets
   - **Verification Method**: How to test/measure compliance
   - **Priority** and **Integrity Level**
   
4. **Apply Labels**:
   - `non-functional-requirement`
   - `phase-02`
   - Category-specific labels if available

#### Example: Creating REQ-F Issue

**Title**: User can filter product list by multiple categories

**Parent Stakeholder Requirement**:
```markdown
**Traces to**: #1 (StR: Improve product discovery experience)
```

**Requirement Description**:
```markdown
The system **shall** allow users to:
1. Select multiple product categories simultaneously (e.g., "Electronics" AND "Sale Items")
2. Apply filters with AND/OR logic
3. See real-time count of matching products
4. Clear all filters with single action
5. Save filter combinations for future use
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```markdown
### Scenario 1: Apply multiple filters
**Given** user is on product listing page  
**And** at least 100 products exist across 5+ categories  
**When** user selects "Electronics" AND "Sale Items" filters  
**Then** system displays only products matching both categories  
**And** product count updates to show "23 items"  
**And** response time is < 500ms

### Scenario 2: Clear filters
**Given** user has 3 filters applied  
**When** user clicks "Clear All Filters" button  
**Then** all filters are removed  
**And** full product list is displayed  
**And** filter count shows "0 active filters"

### Scenario 3: Save filter combination
**Given** user has applied 2+ filters  
**When** user clicks "Save Filters" and enters name "My Electronics Deals"  
**Then** filter combination is saved to user profile  
**And** appears in "Saved Filters" dropdown on next visit
```

**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Integrity Level**: 2 (high criticality)  
**Dependencies**: REQ-F-012 (Product catalog API), REQ-NF-015 (Database query performance)  
**Verification Method**: Test (automated integration tests + manual UAT)

**Labels**: `functional-requirement`, `phase-02`, `priority-high`, `integrity-2`

After submission → Issue #45 created

#### Example: Creating REQ-NF Issue

**Title**: Search results return within 200ms for 95% of queries

**Parent Stakeholder Requirement**:
```markdown
**Traces to**: #2 (StR: Fast, responsive user experience)
```

**Quality Attribute Category**: Performance

**Requirement Description**:
```markdown
The system **shall** return search results with the following performance characteristics:
- **95th percentile**: ≤ 200ms response time
- **99th percentile**: ≤ 500ms response time
- **Average**: ≤ 100ms response time
- **Database queries**: Maximum 3 queries per search
- **Concurrent users**: Performance maintained under 1000 concurrent users
```

**Measurable Criteria**:
```markdown
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| P95 response time | ≤ 200ms | APM tool (New Relic) |
| P99 response time | ≤ 500ms | APM tool |
| Average response | ≤ 100ms | APM tool |
| Query count | ≤ 3 queries | Database profiler |
| Load capacity | 1000 concurrent | Load testing (JMeter) |
```

**Verification Method**:
```markdown
1. **Performance Testing**: JMeter load test with 1000 virtual users
2. **Production Monitoring**: APM tool continuous monitoring
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: All metrics met for 7 consecutive days in production
```

**Priority**: Critical (P0)  
**Integrity Level**: 1 (highest - customer-facing performance)

**Labels**: `non-functional-requirement`, `phase-02`, `priority-critical`, `integrity-1`

After submission → Issue #46 created

#### Traceability via GitHub Issues

Requirements trace to parent stakeholder requirements:
```markdown
## Traceability
- **Traces to**: #1, #2 (parent StR issues)
- **Depends on**: #12, #15 (prerequisite requirements)
- **Refined by**: #78, #79 (child design decisions in Phase 03)
- **Implemented by**: #PR-25 (pull request)
- **Verified by**: #120, #121 (test case issues)
```

**Automated Validation**: GitHub Actions validates:
- Every REQ-F/REQ-NF has at least one parent StR link
- Parent issues exist and are labeled `stakeholder-requirement`
- No circular dependencies
- All dependencies resolved before marking requirement complete

#### Querying Requirements

Use GitHub search:
```
# All functional requirements
is:issue label:functional-requirement label:phase-02

# High priority non-functional requirements
is:issue label:non-functional-requirement label:priority-high

# Performance requirements
is:issue label:non-functional-requirement "performance" in:title

# Requirements tracing to specific StR
is:issue label:functional-requirement "#1" in:body
```

Or use GitHub MCP via Copilot:
```
List all functional requirements for Phase 02
Show non-functional requirements with priority critical
```

#### Generate Requirements Specification from Issues

```bash
# Generate System Requirements Specification document
python scripts/github-traceability-report.py --type requirements --output SyRS.md
```

Produces ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148-compliant specification document from issues.

### 📝 Supplementary Documentation Files

While **GitHub Issues are the single source of truth**, you may create supplementary markdown files in `02-requirements/` folders for:
- Detailed use case descriptions (reference issue #N)
- Complex domain models and diagrams
- Background research and analysis
- Reference documentation

**Critical Rule**: All supplementary files MUST reference the canonical GitHub Issue(s) using `#N` syntax.

## 🚨 Critical Requirements for This Phase

### Always Do
✅ Trace every system requirement to stakeholder requirement(s)  
✅ Define testable acceptance criteria for every requirement  
✅ Include non-functional requirements (not just functional)  
✅ Use consistent requirement IDs (REQ-F-XXX, REQ-NF-XXX)  
✅ Write user stories in Given-When-Then format  
✅ Prioritize with customer involvement (Planning Game)  
✅ Document assumptions and dependencies explicitly  
✅ Validate requirements with stakeholders  
✅ Use "shall" for mandatory binding provisions  
✅ Write requirements that specify "what" not "how" (avoid design constraints)  
✅ Make requirements verifiable and testable with objective criteria  
✅ Use active voice in requirement statements  
✅ Apply YAGNI: specify only for current iteration + 1  
✅ Define acceptance tests BEFORE implementation (ATDD)  
✅ Customer defines acceptance tests  
✅ Focus on delivering value; maximize work NOT done

❌ Mix requirements with design solutions  
❌ Skip non-functional requirements  
❌ Create requirements without acceptance criteria  
❌ Proceed with inconsistent or conflicting requirements  
❌ Specify requirements for "future" features (YAGNI / No gold plating)

❌ Use "must" (use "shall" for mandatory, "should" for desired)  
❌ Write negative requirements ("shall not")  
❌ Wait for requirements to be "finished" before design/implementation  
❌ Build for tomorrow based on hypothetical needs  
❌ Value requirements only for developers (e.g., dictating specific tech stack)
